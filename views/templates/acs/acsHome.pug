h1 About Asian Cultural Society

p.
    Asian Cultural Society (ACS) was formed in 2003 by Founder and current President, Dr. Kwong as a subsidiary to
    Center for Integrated Medicine (CIM). Its purpose back in 2003 was to supplement CIM, Public Education Series (which
    is an education series created to provide workshops in Traditional Chinese Medicine to intern doctors, staff and
    patients) with Chinese culture. ACS is currently a major community- based non-profit organization to preserve the
    common interests of the South Valleyâ€™s Chinese community and also to promote/foster the understanding of the Chinese
    culture to people of non-Asian decent.
