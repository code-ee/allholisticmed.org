            What is Qi Gong, (Chi Kung)? First you should know that “Qi” means “energy”or “air”.  Gong means, “inner work”.
            Thus Qi Gong means , “Guiding Energy” or, “Working of air.” It is the conscious and systematic development of the
            vital energy of the body.

            Qi Gong is a form of exercise and breathing techniques which most, if not all, of Chinese martial arts originate
            from. In performing Qi Gong exercise, the goal is to build up internal Qi.  It is known to keep ones body fit
            healthy and promote long life. There are many different forms of Qi Gong which are practiced within different
            systems. A few examples are  the “Confucian Method.” This method is practiced to emphasize regulation of the mind
            and achieve a state of tranquility which will in turn cultivate moral character.  There is the “Martial Arts
            Method,” which aims to build up the inner strength to the point that he or she becomes invulnerable to both moral
            and physical attack.  And last, but not least, the “Medical Method,” which is practiced to prevent disease, promote
            health and prolong life.
